        \nThis program was written by Christian Torralba for the Advanced Java course at Portland State University.
        \nTo add a flight, click the \"Add a flight\" button.
        \nThis will bring you to a page that will prompt you for all the information regarding the flight.
        \nIf the airline specified does not already exist, then one will be created and stored in an XML file, containing all the related flights.
        \n
        \nTo search for a flight, click the \"Search a flight\" button. This will then bring you to a page where can input the source and destination of a flight.
        \nYou may also filter flights based on specific airline.
        \nTo view an airline and its flights, click the \"Search and Airline\" button. This will then prompt you for an airline name.
        \nIf the specified airline exists, then all the flights related to that airline will be displayed.
        \nYou may also leave the airline name text field blank to see all airlines and all flights.
